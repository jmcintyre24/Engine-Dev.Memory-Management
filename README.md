# Engine-Dev.Memory-Management
Project created for Full Sail University's Engine Development Class to teach us about pools and memory management.

We were given a the template for the bare engine, with no rendering code just the layout, and had labs to build up the engine each week. This was Lab One, where we had to do render particles shooting out like a fountain, destroying them when they get low enough.
